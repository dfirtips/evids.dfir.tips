title: Flash & Super Cookies
description: |
    Local Stored Objects (LSOs), or Flash Cookies, have
    become ubiquitous on most systems due to the extremely
    high penetration of Flash applications across the Internet.
    They tend to be much more persistent because they do
    not expire, and there is no built-in mechanism within the
    browser to remove them. In fact, many sites have begun
    using LSOs for their tracking mechanisms because they
    rarely get cleared like traditional cookies.
