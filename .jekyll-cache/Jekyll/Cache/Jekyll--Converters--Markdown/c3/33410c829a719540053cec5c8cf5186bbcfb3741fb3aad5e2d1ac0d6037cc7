I"ü<ul>
  <li>These are created when a user switches a folder to
thumbnail mode or views pictures via a slide show. As it
were, our thumbs are now stored in separate database files.
Win7+ has 4 sizes for thumbnails and the files in the cache
folder reflect this:
    * 32 -&gt; small - 96 -&gt; medium
    * 256 -&gt; large - 1024 -&gt; extra large</li>
  <li>The thumbcache will store the thumbnail copy of the picture
  based on the thumbnail size in the content of the equivalent
  database file.</li>
</ul>
