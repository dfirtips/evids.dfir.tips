I"·<p>Local Stored Objects (LSOs), or Flash Cookies, have
become ubiquitous on most systems due to the extremely
high penetration of Flash applications across the Internet.
They tend to be much more persistent because they do
not expire, and there is no built-in mechanism within the
browser to remove them. In fact, many sites have begun
using LSOs for their tracking mechanisms because they
rarely get cleared like traditional cookies.</p>
