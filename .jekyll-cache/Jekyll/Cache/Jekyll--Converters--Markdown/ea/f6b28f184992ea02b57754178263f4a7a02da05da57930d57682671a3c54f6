I"u<p>Logon Events can give us very specific information regarding
the nature of account authorizations on a system if we know
where to look and how to decipher the data that we find. In
addition to telling us the date, time, username, hostname, and
success/failure status of a logon, Logon Events also enables us
to determine by exactly what means a logon was attempted.</p>
